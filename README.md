PWA Prototype

Disc Haven App:
  This app is a disc golf online store.  It consists of the following:
    1.  index.html -- home page with about us info
    2.  cart.html -- shopping cart page that includes items the user has placed in the cart
    3.  contact.html -- contact page with Disc Haven contact info
    4.  shop.html -- online shopping pages where items can be added to the cart

Service Worker:  The service worker intercepts and responds to network requests and caches resources so that the PWA can function offline.

Caching strategy:  Assets are cached when the app starts up and when an update is pushed.

Manifest file:  Contains information on how the app looks, all of the icons and allows the app to be downloaded like a native app.
